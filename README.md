# Professional README Generator 

## Description
This is a command-line application that prompts the user questions to then generator their own ReadMe file for their projects. 
As a developer it's important to showcase your work especially when employers look at your GitHub profile. Therefore it's essential to have a good quality README.md file that explains your project, the features, it's usage, and how you developed it. Employers go through thousands of projects which is why it's important to stand out with a README that breaksdown your project.
