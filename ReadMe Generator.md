# ReadMe Generator

  ## Description 
  A command-line application that prompts the user questions to then generator their own ReadMe file for their projects. 
  To challenge and further the skills I learned in node.js and inquirer. To then demonstrate to potential employers my strengths  in programming.
  As a programmer sometimes it's challenging to write a readme file using the correct format. This application helps users easily generate their own readme.md by answering questions about their project.
